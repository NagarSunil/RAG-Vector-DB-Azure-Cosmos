# RAG-Vector-DB-Azure-Cosmos
Summary of Workflow
Azure OpenAI generates embeddings for text.
Cosmos DB stores these embeddings along with the text. FastAPI provides RESTful endpoints to store new documents, query relevant documents, and generate GPT-based responses.
RAG Pipeline combines document retrieval and GPT to produce accurate, context-aware answers. 
This approach ensures efficient and scalable implementation for RAG applications.
